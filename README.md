Easy Rails development using the Zertico Way.
Rails is a great framework, but is not a great idea to let your tests depend on any part of it.
Zertico let you develop what most important: your business logic. Also, your tests will not depend
of rails at all.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'zertico'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zertico

## Basic Usage

First, alter your ApplicationController and extend Zertico::Controller

```ruby
class ApplicationController < Zertico::Controller
end
```

Now, define the routes you need as follow:

```ruby
resources :entries
```

And thats all. All the logic is already defined on the controller. Happy coding. =D

## Advanced Usage

The Zertico::Controller doesn't cover all cases. For those that are not covered you will have to
create a service with the same name of the controller, as follows:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
```

```ruby
module UsersService
    include Zertico::Service
end
```

Your service must be a module and include Zertico::Service to grant access to all the methods already defined.
Then you will have to redefine all the methods you need. Each action of the controller is mapped to a method.
The method has initialize two instance variables: @responder and @options. @responder it the object to send to respond_with
and @options are thw options to pass to respond_with, default to blank hash {}.

Sometimes, the ActiveRecord models grow to much. It start to handle all kinds of logic. To make things simple,
it should only concern about database access. To clean it, use the Zertico::Accessor. It is a wrapper that will
pass all methods to the object unless the ones you overwrite. This way, is easy to start develop better models.

By using Zertico::Controller and Zertico::Accessor, a great part of you project will be simple ruby classes.
It means, better and simple tests, without depend on rails and any other external logic. =D

## Conventions

To work with the gem, you will need to follow some conventions. Your model ( called interface here ) need to
have the same name of your controller, without the 'Controller' substring. The Service need to replace the
'Controller' substring with 'Service' like:

```ruby
class UsersController < Zertico::Controller
end

module UsersService
    include Zertico::Service
end

class UserAccessor < Zertico::Accessor
end

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

It is good to put the services on a separate folder called services.
